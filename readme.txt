ADDITIONAL INFO

  - This game is essentially a parody of a game called "Dark Souls"
    - Dark Souls is a very hard game :( and is known for it.
    - Very Edgy and fantasy
    - Dami Peng drew each and every character frame.
    - Defeat Tyler the pitchfork farmer and Ms. Wong, Lord of Cinder to win the game.
    - This game is honestly kind of yikes.
